<h1>Beyond Sight</h1>
<br/>
<p>Beyond Sight is a simple multiplayer card game based on observing the field of cards on the table and picking and letting go of the right ones.</p>
<br/>
<p>Each player is given a set of cards. The goal is (currently) to reach 40 pts. Points are calculated as the sum of all the <b>sustenance</b> of your cards in hand minus their summed <b>damage</b>.</p>
<p>In order to increase the <b>sustenance</b> of the cards held, or to get rid of the undesirable ones, the player may, during their turn, either pick a card from the table or place one onto it. Cards placed will be flipped, so neither one of the players get to see it. As a turn ends, an <b>effect turn</b> begins.</p>
<p>During an <b>effect turn<b>, each card on the table will display its gained and lost <b>sustenance</b> individually. Certain cards tend to gain <b>sustenance</b> over time, while others tend to decrease the <b>sustenance</b> of nearby cards (while on table). Tracking the assets on the table is essential to grab the most interesting cards and to trick your opponent into fetching bad ones.</p>
<p>The winner is the first player to reach the goal. <p>

This game is yet unfinished, and is meant to be an attempt at testing multiplayer dynamics.
